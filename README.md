# Portfolio: Recipe App

This is a mobile app that allows users to filter/search for and save their favorite recipes. The app features a list of 12 recipes in total, 4 breakfast meals, 4 lunch meals, 4 dinner meals, and 4 snack meals. 
On the home page, the user can filter by meal type, ingredient, or search by keyword through the recipes. 
Selecting a recipe, on either the home page or saved recipes page takes the user to a "recipe details" page of the selected recipe, with the ingredients and preparation instructions for the recipe. This page also allows the user to save a recipe. 
Saving a recipe makes it visible on the saved recipes page, and can be removed by the red 'X' on the recipe card.
